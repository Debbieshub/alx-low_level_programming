My first shot at C programming language

1. 0x00-hello_world is a project introducing us to the C programming language
2. 0x01-if_else_while is a project that opens us up to loops.
3. 0x02-functions_nested_loops is a projsect that introduces us to nested loops
4. 0x03-debugging is a projects that opens us up to debugging skills!
5. 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings is the first introduction to what pointers, arrays and strings mean and their importance in C programming language
6. 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings is a projects on more pointers, features and functions
7. 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings is another projects on more pointers and arrays. Here, multi-dimensional arrays are introduced.
8. 0x08-recursion is a project that opens us up to recursions in C programming
9. 0x09-static_libraries is a start to learning the types of libraries we have!
10. 0x10-variadic_functions is a start to what variadic functions are.
11. 0x0A-argc_argv is a start to learning arguments in C programming
12. 0x0B-malloc_free is an introduction to memory allocation
13. 0x0C-more_malloc_free is a project on more memory allocation functions
14. 0x0D-preprocessor ia a project about preprocessors
15. 0x0E-structures just like the name implies, structures!
16. 0x0F-functions_pointers well, do you know you could point to functions and execute them straight up? well, i just found out!
17. 0x12-singly_linked_lists is an introduction to what singly linked lists are
18. 0x13-more_singly_linked_lists more and more!
19. 0x14-bit_manipulation is a poject on bitwise operators
20. 0x15-file_io introduction to file descriptors
