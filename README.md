My first shot at C programming language

1. 0x00-hello_world is a project introducing us to the C programming language
2. 0x01-if_else_while is a project that opens us up to loops.
3. 0x02-functions_nested_loops is a projsect that introduces us to nested loops
4. 0x03-debugging is a projects that opens us up to debugging skills!
5. 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings is the first introduction to what pointers, arrays and strings mean and their importance in C programming language
6. 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings is a projects on more pointers, features and functions
7. 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings is another projects on more pointers and arrays. Here, multi-dimensional arrays are introduced.
8. 0x08-recursion is a project that opens us up to recursions in C programming
9. 0x09-static_libraries is a start to learning the types of libraries we have!
